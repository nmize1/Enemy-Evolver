# Enemy Evolver

A small twin stick shooter where the enemies (in theory) evolve to grow stronger based on how you play.

To run, run 420 Final.exe and also run UDPServer.py at the same time. 

To open in Unity, place the folder in a folder title EnemyEvolver(or whatever you want to call the project) and then open that folder in Unity. Unity will generate the rest of the needed files. When pushing to Github, only push the folders we have here.
